  <Description> Cycling Sensor example project that demonstrates Cycling Speed and Cadence and Cycling Power services. 
Cycling Speed and Cadence simulates a cycling activity and reports the simulated cycling speed and cadence data to a BLE central device using CSCS.
Cycling Power simulates cycling power data and reports the simulated data to a BLE central device using CPS. </Description>
  <ShortDescription>Shows how to use the Cycling Speed and Cadence Service with the BLE component.</ShortDescription>
