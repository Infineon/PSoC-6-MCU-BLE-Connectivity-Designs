# Introduction
This repository contains examples and demos for PSoC 6 MCU family of devices, a single chip solution for the emerging IoT devices. PSoC 6 MCU bridges the gap between expensive, power hungry application processors and low‑performance microcontrollers (MCUs). The ultra‑low‑power, dual-core architecture of PSoC 6 MCU offers the processing performance needed by IoT devices, eliminating the tradeoffs between power and performance.

Cypress provides a wealth of data at [www.cypress.com](http://www.cypress.com/) to help you select the right PSoC device and effectively integrate it into your design. Visit our [PSoC 6 MCU](http://www.cypress.com/products/32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-psoc-6) webpage to explore more about PSoC 6 MCU family of device.
Feel free to explore through the code example source files and let us innovate together!
